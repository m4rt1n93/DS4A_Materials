Small businesses in Colombia, located mostly at middle- and lower-class localities, are dedicated to real selling of massive consuming goods. The owners of these establishments are micro-merchants engaged in the retail sector, particularly in Fast Moving Consumer Goods through a traditional channel that contributes more than 50% of the sales of mass consumption in our country. In order to provide micro- merchants with digital channels that directly connect them with product manufacturers and mass consumption services, new companies like Teaté are connecting suppliers of goods and services with micro-merchants, thus allowing thousands of shopkeepers to supply their businesses through a mobile application. Although these initiatives could improve the efficacy of the entire retail distribution channel, these companies have some needs and gaps to fill. In particular, Teaté needs to gain knowledge about the market behavior and the demand of shopkeepers in order to avoid inefficiencies in the process and consequent losses of time and money. In this project we will use a Big Ben VEC Forecasting Algorithm to predict the demand in the marketplace using data sales from Teaté. We expect the results of this project will allow the company and its clients to allocate resources appropriately, plan their strategy for the future and take better decisions about the investments required to accomplish their goals. We think this would contribute to engine the social and economic growth in Colombia as we are supporting a strategy with the potential of rebuilding the social fabric along with the digital transformation of the micro-merchant retail sector.
